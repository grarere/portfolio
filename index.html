<H1> GRACIELA  </H1>
<p>I was born in Mexico city, I moved to Canada to Montreal in 2004, then in 2014 I moved to Calgary.
 I've been working as a pastry chef for many years but what Ilike the most is to design special cakes paint them with airbrush and sculpt figures in cakes.
 I also enjoy playing music, I play percussions: drum set, marimba,any kind of druming. I'm studing Graphic design because 
I love to be creative with an specific purpose.
